Common usage patterns
=====================

Basic concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any call you do, in response youâ€™ll get httpx response object. So
you can do anything with it as per `httpx
docs <https://www.python-httpx.org/quickstart/>`__. You can parse
response as json, read http status code, response headers and all that
good stuff.

Note that responses are only of two kinds - successes (< 400) & errors
(>= 400). Please refer to the documentation of API for response format
in each individual case.

Unlike successful responses, errors are always the same format which can
be easily parsed. Please refer to the documentation of API for errors
format.
